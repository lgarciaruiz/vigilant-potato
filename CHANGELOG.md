## 0.1.0 - First Release
* Every feature added
* Every bug fixed

## 0.1.1 - Multiple Files Bug
* Added warning for when multiple files are found; will not update anything if that is the case
* Fixed README notes

## 0.2.0 - Second Release
* When multiple files are found with the same name it will look for the path of the files to determine which file to update. This will require that your atom editor have the same folder structure as SFMC. If only one file with the name exists then the file path will not matter and behavior will not change.
* Added better warning messages.

## 2.0.0 - Bender Bending Rodriguez Version
* Added support for a test and production environment.
